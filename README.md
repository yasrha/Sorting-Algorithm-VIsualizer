# Sorting Algorithms Visualization Web App

This is a simple web application built using React that allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms. The app displays a line with 10 bars of different lengths, representing an array of integers from 1 to 10. You can randomize the order of the bars, select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu, and then click the "Sort" button to see the sorting process in action.
